# MapViewer
MapViewer is a macOS application designed to provide a seamless and efficient way to visualize geospatial data in map format. With a focus on simplicity and speed, MapViewer makes it easy for users to interpret and analyze geospatial information on their Mac devices.

# Features
1. Geospatial Data Visualization: Quickly visualize various geospatial data formats on an interactive map.
2. Support for multiple geojson data turned into multiple layers
3. Support for basic vector data type such as point, polyline and polygon

## Technologies & Best Practices:
1. Swift:
Swift is a powerful and intuitive programming language developed by Apple for building iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and Linux applications. Swift incorporates modern programming concepts to enhance code safety, reducing the likelihood of errors and designed for high-performance applications, Swift offers speed comparable to C and Objective-C.
Swift's clean syntax makes it easy to read and write, improving code readability.

2. SwiftUI:
SwiftUI is a declarative UI framework introduced by Apple, enabling developers to build user interfaces across all Apple platforms using a single codebase. SwiftUI allows developers to describe the UI's appearance and behavior in a declarative manner, making code concise and easy to understand. Developers can see real-time previews of the UI changes while coding, streamlining the development and debugging process.

3. MapKit:
MapKit is a framework provided by Apple for embedding maps and location-based services into iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS applications.
MapKit enables developers to display interactive maps with various styles and overlays. with custom annotations, pins, and callouts to the map for enhanced information display.

4. Combine
Combine is a framework introduced by Apple to handle asynchronous and event-driven code using a declarative Swift API.

5. MVVM
Employing the Model-View-ViewModel architecture, MapViewer separates concerns, leading to a clean and maintainable codebase.
